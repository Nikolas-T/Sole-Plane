## Description

This project is a inspirational react project. This project is built for those known as sneakerheads. A sneakerhead is a person who appreciates sneakers as a fashion or aesthetic item and often collects many pairs as a hobby. That guy's a real sneakerheadâ€”he/she must have a few hundred pairs, easy.
The purpose of this app is to give a collector a way to find different shoes for the best price.
A sneaker database Api was used to gather all the information needed to supply the best results to the views.
